{   "ruleRound": "During the first round after gaining a status, the players take turns saying one word related to the location. After that, the participants ask each other questions to identify the spy.",

    "ruleOverview": "In each round, players find themselves in some location. Each player has a different status. Most of the participants get the 'Resident' status and know the name of the location. One or more players receive the 'Spy' status. Spies don't know where they are. The task of spies is to make the rest of the players talk, determine the location and not get exposed. Non-spy players, in turn, try to make it clear to allies that they knows where they are, and therefore don't have a 'Spy' status.",
